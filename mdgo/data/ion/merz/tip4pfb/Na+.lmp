# This set of values is optimized for reproducing ion-oxygen distance (Table 3) using
# the TIP4P-FB water model
# all values in 'real' units (kcal/mol and Angstrom)

# Note that LAMMPS requires the value sigma (the distance at which the potential equals
# zero, rather than Rmin/2 which is reported in the paper. To convert, use
# sigma = Rmin/2 * 2^(5/6)
